# May 21

After killing the Umber Hulk, that Karbo guy opened a trap door and shouted down that we "passed the test".  
We had the option to go back up the stairs, but Carpet picked a lock and opened a door to the east.  They
found a short hallway, another door they got open, and then led into a tomb/burial area.


Found a sarcophogus, with an inscription outside identifying him as "Samodar _____, Defender of the North"

Carpetburn & Randall opened the sarcophogus, found a recent corpse inside it... of a mirabar knight.
There was a hammer-like symbol on breastplate.  I searched the body, found a personal note of some sort,
presumably signed by the knight - "Eledar".  Stuck that letter in my journal.

Randall and Paris worked on removing the breastplate to try to take it back as evidence as well, when
six zombies started climbing out of other crypts in the area.

Randall attempted to turn the undead - and half of them ran in terror.  I magic missiled one. Another
one slammed Carpetburn into the wall - his Hellish Rebuke killed it. Vanquish dodged an attack, Paris 
stabbed one, dashed across the room, and finished off the one I'd shot.

Took a short rest, poked around the mine-like tunnels, and stumbled into a iron-gated set blocking a 
set of stairs down.  The stairs were obviously  very high quality dwarven carved.  Paris struggled to
pry or bend the bars of the gate, but it was clearly too well secured.

The clattering of the work woke something up, though... as a large giant came charging up the hallway
at us.  My web spell didn't faze him.  Paris charged, tripped him with his spear, and stabbed him.  
Vanquish barkskinned Paris.  Randall charged in and Inflicted Wounds, adding a bit more damage.  
Carpetburn popped back over, after apparently telling off Kwark and his friends.  I threw an icebolt, 
Vanquish produced flame... and he dropped.

The giant had a silver ring set with rubies, and a Ring of Fire Resistance.

We hit level 5.





Randall's god -- "Sayaneen Moonbow"
