Decided to travel to the Sacred Stone monastary, despite my bad feelings about the whole idea, and suspicions that we're working for the bad guys.

Uneventful day hike, overnight camp, and second half-day hike to the monastary.

We arrived, poked around the outside of the building, and apparently were noticed.   A panel on the main door (to the south) opens, and 
a female monk wearing a golden gargoyle mask asks what we want.  A little discussion of how I was a sage and historian got us inside, 
and an introduction to the

Was asked why we thought we were worthy to be a servant of Eternal Earth.  We said we weren't even sure we wanted to join anything... and
we got dumped through a trap door into a dungeon, where an umber hulk was locked up.   We managed to kill it quickly; it only got one real attack, 
but that slashed Randal to shreds.  We got him stabilized, and ended the session.  Notable moment in the fight - Vanquish, in hornbunny form, got himself stuck on the umber hulks butt.
