Quick rest after fighting the giant.  We decided to give Randal the Fire Resistance ring.

Continued exploring the cave, down south, and then east.  Found a group of 12 or so prisoners in three cells.  

Brundelthar -- one of the prisoners, promises some information regarding the Mirabar delegation if we help them escape.
He says the prison guard is in the room just west and north.   We hatch a plan to ambush the guards, and have the 
prisoners start screaming and yelling.  One guard (Jareth) comes out, Carpetburn backstabs and kills him.  He pulls  Jareth's body
out of visible range, and a couple moments later two more guards come out.  We launch into combat.
Paris charges, screaming; frightening the guards, stabbing the closer one, and hitting the farther one with his spear butt.
I hit the closer one with a set of magic missiles, then Carpetburn backstabbed him and killed him.

Paris attacked the other one again, Randal tried to cast Hold Person, but he resisted.  I hit him with a batch of missiles.  He
tried swinging back and Paris, but his woundes were so severe he collapsed in the attempt.  

We disarmed him, tried to get him to give us information.  He refused, saying he wouldn't betray the cult, then started shouting
"Miraj Vizann!" over and over.  Carpetburn silenced him permanently.

We set the prisoners loose, and discovered they were part of the Mirabar delagation.   I showed him the letter I found on the knight,
and he knew the name immediately, described him as "a brother in arms."  They wanted to come along and fight the monks with us,
but we talked them into staying and resting, then escaping.  Carpetburn searched the guards room, and handed out 33gp to each of us
that he found.

We headed back up to the main floor, where Kwark met us, along with a couple of the guards, and two minotaurs.  He was very congratulatory 
and complementary towards us.  I mentioned the name the guard was shouting (Miraj Vizann) and that seemed to impress him... he sent us to 
meet Helenra, who apparently runs the monestary.

We went to a small square room.  A human female martial artist, clearly blind, was practicing on a mat in the center.  A guard stood
in each of the four corners.  One by one, she asked us to step on the mat, and she took a swing at us.  Most of us took our punch, 
and maybe dealt a little back.  Paris was last... and he refused to step up.  seeing this as nothing but bullying.   The guards 
surrounded him, and she attacked -- but he stopped her cold with his reaction, got in a small hit... and Carpetburn stabbed her
from behind in stealth and destroyed her.  She collapsed in a heap on the floor, and we got a key off her that looks to be of
ancient dwarven make.

Elmer got the idea to head for ale, and we ended up following him back across the monastary, and stopped just as we met Kwark
and his friends.
