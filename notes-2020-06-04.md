The Silverhorn Knights once controlled the whole area via a series of castles, but were overrun by orcs later. More 
recently, these are referred to as the Haunted Keeps.   The half-orc barkeep back in Red Larch is a descendant of them.  

Armor that the monastery guards wear is obviously related to the rocky-armored 


Ran into Karbo in the hallway... he asked how we could be done with our lessons from Hellenra.  We admitted that we
had defeated her, and he shouted for "Renwick".    A cloud of green smoke, and a big skeletal looking guy appeared 
who shot Melfs Acid Arrow at Paris.

Vanquish flung an ice knife, which missed.  I cast Minute Meteors, and hit him with 2 of them - he didsn't seem to
notice the damage.  Randall tried turning undead, but it resisted him.  Paris struck at him but found his spear
seemed ineffective.  Vanquish's ice knife didn't seem to do much either.   Renwick attempts to cast something, but
I counterspell him.  I managed a second round of meteors along with a burst of magic missiles, and the volley did 
have a noticable impact.  Randall attempted a touch-range damage spell, which failed; Renwick hit him with something
that ripped him up pretty well.  Vanquish healed him some.  Randall cast a spell that summoned
a cloud of little angelic figures, who attacked all the enemies in range... which seemed to be pretty effective
towards the undead guy.

Renwick cast a Mirror Image, our various attacks end up picking off the illusions.  We end up whittling him down to
collapse.  

Karbo, having watched the whole fight, drops to a knee and says he wants no trouble from us.  Paris gets intimidating
and Karbo says we'll get no resistance from him.  After seeing us defeat the lich-thing, he is a little more cooperative.

He says only that we should seek out someone named Marlos Enulah.  "Look to the Earth, find your path, seek out Marlos."

Paris makes it clear that we are going to release the prisoners, and that he will let them go.  The monks don't 
block it.  We escort the prisoners to the body of their fallen friend Eledar; they take his body, as well as the letter
we found, and leave the monastery safely.

I identify the amulet and potion we got from Renwick -- an Amulet of Health (which goes to Randall)  and potion of 
Greater Healing.

We then head down stairs, through the ancient dwarven gate, and down a cleanly carved passage that looks to be of the
same age as the key and gate.  The path crosses a chasm, then opens into a room, with a large door 

We ran into a man named Nartham, who is riding on a Burrowshark.  He has a handful of Hobgoblin guards with him, who
also wear the Earthen armor.   He makes some sort of handsign, which Prais and Vanquish were quick enough to emulate.  
We mention the directions Karbo gave us, and he invites us in to talk.
